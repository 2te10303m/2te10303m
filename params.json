{"name":"Dasher","tagline":"A simple way to bridge your Amazon Dash buttons to HTTP services","body":"# Dasher\r\n\r\nDasher is a simple way to bridge your Amazon Dash buttons to HTTP services.\r\n\r\nDo you have a Home Automation service set up like [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), [openHab](http://www.openhab.org), or\r\nmaybe a SmartThings hub? Using Dasher, you can easily command them to do\r\nsomething whenever your Dash button is pressed.\r\n\r\nThis of course goes for anything you can reach via HTTP. That includes IFTTT by\r\nway of the Maker channel :metal:\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nIt's pretty simple. Press a button and an HTTP request is made. That's it.\r\n\r\nYou configure your Dash button(s) by defining it in a configuration file. Add its network\r\naddress, a url, an http method, and optionally a content body and headers.\r\n\r\nWhen Dasher starts, it will listen for your button being pressed. Once it sees\r\nit, it will then make the HTTP request that you defined for it in your configuration.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/maddox/dasher).\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what it takes to set up your buttons. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"buttons\":[\r\n  {\r\n    \"title\": \"Notify\",\r\n    \"address\": \"43:02:dc:b2:ab:23\",\r\n    \"url\": \"https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/Notify/with/key/5212ssx2k23k2k\",\r\n    \"method\": \"POST\",\r\n    \"json\": true,\r\n    \"body\": {\"value1\": \"any value\", \"value2\": \"another value\", \"value3\": \"wow, even more value\"}\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"title\": \"Party Time\",\r\n    \"address\": \"d8:02:dc:98:63:49\",\r\n    \"url\": \"http://192.168.1.55:8123/api/services/scene/turn_on\",\r\n    \"method\": \"POST\",\r\n    \"headers\": {\"authorization\": \"your_password\"},\r\n    \"json\": true,\r\n    \"body\": {\"entity_id\": \"scene.party_time\"}\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"title\": \"Start Cooking Playlist\",\r\n    \"address\": \"66:a0:dc:98:d2:63\",\r\n    \"url\": \"http://192.168.1.55:8181/playlists/cooking/play\",\r\n    \"method\": \"PUT\"\r\n  },\r\n]}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
